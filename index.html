  <h1>Privacy Policy - Notifikacije Masinac</h1>
  
  <p><strong>Vies Studios</strong> built the Notifikacije Masinac app as a Free app. This SERVICE is provided by Vies Studios at no cost and is intended for use as is.</p>
  
  <p>This privacy policy describes how Notifikacije Masinac collects, uses, and shares your information when you use our application. By using our app, you agree to the terms outlined in this policy.</p>
  
  <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
  
  <p>We collect only one piece of data: the Firebase ID associated with your device. This ID is used to identify your device for push notifications.</p>
  
  <p>The app does use third-party services that may collect information used to identify you.</p>
  
  <p>Link to the privacy policy of third-party service providers used by the app:</p>

      <li><a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Firebase</a></li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Data Transmission</h2>
  
  <p>Please note that the Firebase ID is transmitted over unencrypted traffic. This means that there is a potential risk of interception by third parties.</p>
  
  <h2>Data Storage</h2>
  
  <p>We store your Firebase ID in a Firebase database, which is a cloud-based platform provided by Google. This ID is retained for the duration of your use of the app, after which it is deleted in 90 days. Firebase employs robust security measures, including data encryption and secure access controls, to protect the data stored within it.</p>

  <h2>Cookies</h2>
  <p>Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are commonly used as anonymous unique identifiers. These are sent to your browser from the websites that you visit and are stored on your device's internal memory.

  This Service does not use these “cookies” explicitly. However, the app may use third-party code and libraries that use “cookies” to collect information and improve their services. You have the option to either accept or refuse these cookies and know when a cookie is being sent to your device. If you choose to refuse our cookies, you may not be able to use some portions of this Service.</p>
  <h2>User Rights</h2>

  <p>You have the right to request a copy of your Firebase ID that we hold. If you wish for it to be corrected or deleted, please contact us using the details provided below.</p>
  
  <h2>Security</h2>
  
  <p>While we take precautions to ensure the security of the Firebase ID during transmission, we cannot guarantee its absolute safety due to the unencrypted nature of its transmission. However, once received, the data is securely stored in the Firebase database.</p>
  
  <h2>Links to Other Sites</h2>
  
  <p>This Service may contain links to other sites. If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that site. Note that these external sites are not operated by me. Therefore, I strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of these websites. I have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.</p>
  
  <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
  
  <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page, and if significant changes are made, we will notify users through the app.
  
  This policy is effective as of 2023-08-26</p>
